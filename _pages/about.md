I am currently an MPhil student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/gs/). My research focuses on large language model and embodied intelligence, with particular interest in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and their applications. I aim to explore how large language models can be integrated with perception and control systems to enable robots to perform long-horizon, fine-grained tasks in open environments. My recent work involves building datasets for robotic drawing and evaluating emerging VLA architectures on complex trajectory-following benchmarks. More broadly, I am interested in multimodal learning, human-robot interaction, and the development of open-source tools that bridge natural language understanding with physical actions. My long-term goal is to contribute to advancing generalizable and adaptive robotic intelligence.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
